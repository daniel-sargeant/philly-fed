# React & D3 Exercise for Philly Fed

Objective: Build out a D3 chart and a simple two column layout that condenses to a one column layout. On mobile only, a user can click the heading to expand and collapse the sub content.

### Notes

* The prototypes included a dropdown for a month selector in each date field, but the provided dataset only offered data by year. I was unable to find a version of the same data with a month breakdown, so just went with years in the select drop-downs.

### Setup

To run the app locally, clone the repo and run `yarn install && yarn start`.
